# SpringBone
This is a modified version of Anim Graph Spring Controller that additionally allows you to limit translation in specific axis and specific directions. It also has a component space simulation mode.

The node is named "Limited Spring Controller".

I originally made this because I wanted to use a spring controller for my character's helmet but didn't want it to be able to clip through his head.

To see the difference you can look at the community tools thread here: https://forums.unrealengine.com/community/community-content-tools-and-tutorials/1660934-spring-controller-with-limited-axis-useful-for-helmets-that-want-a-spring-controller

## Installation
Clone/download to your project's Plugins directory (you may need to create this, it goes alongside content folder).

Compile your project (to compile the plugin).

Open your project. If you have mismatched engine version it will build. Enable it in the Plugins window in UE4. That's it, now it should be available as a node in the animation graph "Limited Spring Controller"
